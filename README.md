# Net simulator

- Structural deformation solver for a squared net panel or a net cage.
- Nodes are subject to linear-elastic interconnections with frictional dissipation, parametrized hydrodynamic (drag and lift) forces, and gravitational forces.
- Includes several iterative methods for time integration.

Possible additions:
- More complex net geometries.
- Constrained dynamics between the nodes.
